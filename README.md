# PwnPi
This project is the PoC (Proof-of-Concept) project that raspberry pi can be used as pwn tool,
and using the [RPi zero w][0] as the main development hardware.

## install.sh ##
The `install.sh` file is the kickstart script for building the PwnPi which is based on the
[Archlinux ARM][1]: try to minimal the size of everything PwnPi used.

The purpose of this file is to create the basic image for the PwnPi and developer can
access the PwnPi without any pain. NOTE, the main development environment I used is Linux
server and Mac OS X, and all setting in PwnPi are compatible on these two platforms.
